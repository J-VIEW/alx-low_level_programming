# malloc - memory allocation. <br>
 It is a standard library function in the C and C++ programming languages (and in many other languages as well) that is used to dynamically allocate a block of memory during program execution.<br>
 This dynamically allocated memory is typically located on the heap, which is a region of memory separate from the stack.<br>

The malloc function takes one argument, which is the number of bytes of memory to allocate, and it returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block. <br>
The allocated memory is uninitialized, meaning it contains arbitrary data until you explicitly store values in it.
